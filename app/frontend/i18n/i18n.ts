These collaborators are then only able to access specific sections of the application—those that they are specifically assigned to. Importantly, while the author and one person they designate (Designated Submitter) can submit the completed application, all collaborators must have a verified Building Permit HUB account using BCeID to ensure security. Additionally, the author retains the exclusive right to remove or reassign collaborators.
